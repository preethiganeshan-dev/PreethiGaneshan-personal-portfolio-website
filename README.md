 This repository contains source code of Preethi's personal portfolio website. 
 
 A new component library, Lego.html, was first created as a modular approach to web development. These reusable components were then used across the various pages in the website to ensure consistency of theme.
 
 The stylesheet style.css was created for the lego components (Global Nav, Global Header, Footer, etc.) in a fashion similar to frameworks like Bootstap.
 
 Entensive usage of semantic HTML in the lego components will ensure that all our webpages check the box in this area of SEO and accessibility.
